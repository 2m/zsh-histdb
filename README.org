#+TITLE:ZSH History Database

This is a small bit of zsh code that stores your history into a sqlite3 database.
It improves on the normal history by storing, for each history command:

- The start and stop times of the command
- The working directory where the command was run
- The hostname of the machine
- A unique per-host session ID, so history from several sessions is not confused
- The exit status of the command

It is also possible to merge multiple history databases together without conflict, so long as all your machines have different hostnames.
